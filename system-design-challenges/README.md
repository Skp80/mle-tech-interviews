# System Design summary

What you **will** find:  
This readme file is meant to contain the most basic learnings out of reviewing dozens of real interview questions about System Design. Note that for every problem I will only add the most relevant, distinguished and unique ideas behind the solution. You might find the notes a bit cryptic, since this is not meant to be an educative resource. Feed free to throw a PR if you wish to elaborate on something

What you **will not** find here:  
The whole problem description / statement nor the whole solution to the problem.
